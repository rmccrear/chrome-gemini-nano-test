# Chrome Gemini Nano Demo

This is a simple demo showcasing the new `window.ai` API in Chrome Canary, which exposes the Gemini Nano language model to JavaScript applications. This differs from other language models in that it is runs on-device, rather than in the cloud. It opens up the possibility of making cost-free (for the developer) AI enabled web apps.
